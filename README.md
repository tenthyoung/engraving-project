# engraving-project

pseudocode:

- get an event listener on the input
- on the first key stroke it should select the second image as the target
- then it should add the letters by creating an element with an id, that can be translated with css, or maybe I can just add the CSS with JS because then it'll be easier to add it, but it also needs to overwrite the letters that are already there, so I may need to find an image where there isn't an engraving
- I'll then have to use some CSS to solidify
- And then when they click enter or click elsewhere that engraving should stick
- To make it mobile friendly, I'll probably have to use percents
